The [Data organization](Data-organization) and [Computational organization](Computational-organization) pages describe principles used in the Flywheel system.  Understanding these principles is important to effectively use the **scitran** and **Flywheel SDK** software. 

Those pages are intentionally short, providing a _'Read Me First'_ introduction. Over time we will add links with more examples and explanations.

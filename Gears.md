Certain types of programs are important utilities that are run by many different users. Rather than having every user install, it is possible to install the program within Flywheel as a *Gear*.  The installation is usually managed by Flywheel itself or by the site manager.  You can see the set of *Gears* installed at your site by clicking on 'Gears installed' on the left panel of the Flywheel web page.

### Utility Gears

An example of an important utility used by many people is [**dcm2niix**](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) by Chris Rorden and his colleagues.  This important utility converts DICOM files to the NIfTI files that many people use in their data analysis.  Flywheel sites typically have a Gear that can be run automatically to convert DICOM files.  This is a 'Utility Gear'.

### Analysis Gears

Another important program is [**FreeSurfer**](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), by Bruce Fischl and his colleagues. This is a tool that performs many analyses of T1 anatomical files.  If you obtain permission from the MGH group, you can run this 'Analysis Gear' on a Flywheel site.

The advantage of running these Gears within Flywheel is that (a) you do not have to download and install the program itself, (b) the version and time when you ran the program is archived on the site itself, and (c) the outputs of the program are stored on the site either adjacent to the data (Utility Gear) or in an Analysis page (Analysis Gear).

    % Brain Imaging Data Structure
    %
    % Bids class to read and validate the directory tree and files, and
    % then the file contents.  We refer to a particular instance of a bids
    % class as @bids.
    %
    % The BIDS data need to be organized in place by the user on the local
    % disk prior to upload.  If they are BIDS compliant, then we can upload
    % them to a Flywheel database.  If they are on a Flywheel database, we
    % can download them to a BIDS compliant directory tree.
    %
    % Meta data files and folders are specified relative to the root directory
    %
    % These are paths to files.  We store these paths relative to the root
    % directory.  In general, to see the fullpath use something like
    %
    %    fullfile(directory,projectMeta{1});
    %    fullfile(directory,projectMeta{1});
    %
    % To find a specific data filename in a bids object use this syntax.
    % Note the array of structs () and the array of cells {}.
    %
    %   ii = subject, jj = session, and kk = file 
    %   fileName = @bids.dataFiles(ii).session(jj).dataType{kk}
    %   fullfile(directory,fileName);
    %
    % To validate use: @bids.validate;
    %
    % To see the allowable data types: @bids.dataTypes
    %
    % Example:
    %   thisBids = bids(fullfile(stRootPath,'local','BIDS-examples','ds001'));
    %   thisBids.nParticipants
    %   thisBids.validate
    %   sum(thisBids.nSessions)

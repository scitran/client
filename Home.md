The **scitran matlab client** provides tools so that Matlab users can interact with the a scitran database. The main use is to read and analyze data from a [Flywheel](https://flywheel.io) data and computational management system.

This wiki page describes the general software and provides many examples, such as how to

* obtain authorization to read/write from a Flywheel database
* search the database
* download database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload results (e.g., files, graphs, other attachments)
* upload method descriptions (e.g., analyses, Gears) and programs (e.g., Matlab files) that others can run

The **scitran matlab client** can be run securely from any computer on the Internet to process data stored in a scitran database either using their local computer or from a larger computational resource such as a compute engine on the cloud.

There is also a [**scitran python client** implementation](https://github.com/scitran/python-client).

The Wandell lab gratefully acknowledge the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) and particularly the [Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative](https://sfari.org/) for their support of the [Project on Scientific Transparency](http://post.stanford.edu).  The code in this repository and the api functionality are being developed by Michael Perry, Renzo Frigato, and Brian Wandell.

The **scitran matlab client** provides tools so that Matlab users can interact with the a scitran database. The main use is to read and analyze data from a [Flywheel](https://flywheel.io) implementation of the scitran data and computational management system.

The **scitran matlab client** can be run securely from any computer on the Internet. We have used the client extensively on Mac and somewhat on Linux systems.  We have not tested on Windows systems yet, but we plan to do so.

This wiki describes the software and provides examples including

* obtain authorization to read/write from a Flywheel database
* search the database
* download database objects (e.g., files, sessions, projects, analyses)
* upload results (e.g., files, graphs, other attachments)
* upload method descriptions (e.g., analyses, Gears) and programs (e.g., Matlab files) that others can run
* paper of the future (pof) efforts

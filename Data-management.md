Scitran data management methods enable you to find database contents, get information about these objects, download and upload files, and modify metadata. See the [Flywheel terms](Flywheel-terms) page to learn about the conceptual organization of Flywheel data.

## Methods
To learn about the scitran methods read the examples in these wiki pages. Perhaps simplest, we encourage you to type help or doc to bring up the current information in the method, say

    doc scitran.MethodName

Over time, as the methods input and return parameters stabilize, we will put more information in the wiki. Here is a link to a [list of scitran methods](scitran-methods) that we are trying to keep updated.
